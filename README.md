**CLARA** (_CL Accuracy Reference Agent_) is an agentic validation pipeline designed to improve the quality and reliability of the [Cell Ontology (CL)](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology) by verifying that term-level assertions are supported by referenced literature.

The system retrieves relevant full-text references for CL terms and automatically checks whether both formal and textual definitions are substantiated. Built on top of [PaperQA2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04304) (Skarlinski et al., 2024), the current prototype has demonstrated high accuracy in detecting hallucinations and identifying unsupported claimsâ€”making it a valuable tool for ontology curators.

### âœ¨ Features

- Automated evidence validation for Cell Ontology term assertions
- Uses LLM-based semantic search (PaperQA2) to retrieve and assess supporting literature
- Integrates with GitHub Actions to run on pull requests, validating proposed terms and edits
- Supports synonym-aware matching and confidence scoring
- Designed to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy
